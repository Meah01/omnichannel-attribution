# (IN DEVELOPMENT) Omnichannel Attribution integration with Salesforce (Bunq Case Study) 

Currently working on the project. Published publicly tho to use the GitHub Workflows to automate the pipeline.<br>
Uses Bunq as a case study and example. The company is not associated with this project in any way or form. 

## Aimed features
- GitHub workflow automation
- Synthethic data generators which mimic the data formats of exported through platform API's of Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc
- Keeping everything 100% free

### Salesforce features
- Basic attribution models dashboards of the data (time decay, first touch, last touch, position-based)
- Advanced attribution model dashboards (Markov and Shapley)
- Comparison dashboard between models

- CLV segmentation
- Monte Carlo simulation forecasting
- LLM integration (probably Mistral 7B) for data interpretability and recommandations for optimization

## Stages & Current progress
üóπ Phase 0 - Logic building, modelling and assumptions (currently transfering it from docs to my website, check it out: https://tasteful-motion-cd2.notion.site/Omnichannel-Attribution-Budget-Optimization-Platform-IN-DEVELOPMENT-21f06ad0ff588043bbcafd5b69144d9d)<br> 
üóπ Phase 1 - Synthethic data generators and CJ builder<br>
‚òê Phase 2 - Basic attribution models + advanced attribution models + their dashboards + data import via SF REST API<br>
            (currently working on the data import to test the basic dashboards + Markov)<br>
‚òê Phase 3 - CLV + Monte Carlo<br>
‚òê Phase 4 - LLM integration<br>

## Disclaimer
While the project involves a high degree of complexity, and it does take a great deal of time, the following needs to be clarified:
- 100% of the logic behind the app is made by the author
- I am using Claude.ai to help with the code development through Contextual Engineering (which is different from vibe coding)
- 100% of the data is synthethically generated by the scripts developed in this project
- There is no association between the author and any of the companies mentioned above
- This is a portfolio project (as in there is no intent to financially benefit from it)
